I follow the Golden State Warriors closely, drawing lessons from their teamwork and ability to adapt under pressure. My coaching approach revolves around building discipline, encouraging teamwork, and pushing players to improve both mentally and physically, just as Stephen Curry does on the court. With each team I coach, I focus on developing well-rounded players and fostering a winning mentality.",
